# Getting started

The workshop will involve live coding, showing how one can use a Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis in napari and then make simple widgets based on that. For this, magicgui will be introduced as a way to generate widgets quickly and easily.

## Audience

The workshop is intended for people with some experience with (bio)image analysis and some familiarity with the napari application in Python who want to take the next steps to customize/extend the napari GUI. 

## Goals
The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to using `magicgui` to create widgets for `napari`, as well as using custom keybindings. By the end of the workshop, participants should be able to:
- Use `magicgui` to convert functions into widgets for `napari`
- Create custom keybindings for `napari` using `bind_key`
- Use `napari` from a Jupyter notebook or script

## Pre-workshop setup

Before the workshop, please ensure you have an up-to-date `conda` installation and the proper environment for the workshop. See instructions [here](./installation.md).

## Workshop content

The executed and rendered notebooks are [included in this repository](notebooks/index.md). We strongly encourage you to follow along with your own, fresh notebook. However, if you would like to down load and execute the completed notebooks locally, please see [the instructions here](notebook_setup.md). Additionally, the completed notebooks can also be run in the cloud [using Binder](launching_binder.md).
