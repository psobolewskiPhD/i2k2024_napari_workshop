# Notebooks

We encourage you to follow along with your own, fresh notebook, using the executed and rendered notebooks included in this repository only as a guide.  

The first notebook, [Exploratory analysis: spot detection](spot_detection), walks through a simple spot detection workflow using napari. The second notebook, [From workflow to widget: customizing napari](spot_detection_functions), builds on that and demonstrates how to convert the workflow into reusable widgets and a key-bound function.

In this repository, all notebooks have been converted to MyST Markdown files
(with a `.md` extension), because this format is easier to visualize on GitHub.
This also makes it easier to view differences between versions of the notebooks
on the GitHub interface.  
To run these notebooks locally, please see the instructions [here](../notebook_setup.md).
